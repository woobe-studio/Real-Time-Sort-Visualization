# 🎉 Real-Time Sort Visualization 🎉

Welcome to the Real-Time Sort Visualization project! This tool showcases various sorting algorithms with interactive visualizations. Here’s what you can expect:

- 🔄 **Five Sorting Algorithms** with O(n log n) time complexity
- ⏱️ **Execution Time Tracking** for each algorithm
- ⚙️ **Adjustable Settings**: Delay duration and number of elements to sort

The project is ready for setup on both Windows and web environments. For web deployment, please check the previous commit for the web folder, as it was removed for Firebase hosting setup. Setting up on Firebase is straightforward—just follow their tutorial.

If you need further details or have specific requirements, feel free to ask!
